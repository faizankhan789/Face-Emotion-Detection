#Libraries used in this project

Tensorflow -->  TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It 
		can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

keras --> 	provides an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern 
		deep learning. Keras covers every step of the machine learning workflow, from data processing to hyperparameter tuning to deployment.

pandas -->	Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

Numpy -->	NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.

tqdm -->	Tqdm is a popular Python library that provides a simple and convenient way to add progress bars to loops and iterable objects.

opencv-contrib --> These additional modules cover a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, image processing, feature extraction, and more.
